# EE541_Project


req (temp)

Format
no required format, though "conference paper" format is nice, compact
properly referenced
incorporate all source code and links all external code sources (appendicies)
no required length
Latex not required, just *submit PDF*
Summarize
topic
relevant background (theoretical or applied)
milestones / timeline / contributions
document challenges
MUST answer (explicit, in conclusion/closing):
extensions, not just "we could make it better", "could use more data", provide AT LEAST ONE GOOD extension
what question do you feel "answered" after this project
what are you still curious about after this project
Must include
a mini “literature survey” of work already done in your problem domain. Understand network architectures used in similar models,
experimental results with various models (both ML and DL) and performance comparison. Use different architectures and hyperparameters,
evidence of good data handling and processing, i.e., maintain separate test, train, and validation sets.
Depth
sufficient that an uninformed expert to understand:
models
your analytic decisions
architecture and implementation decisions
outcomes
engineering challenges. 
!!provide quantifiable metrics to justify engineering tradeoffs.
 

Grading Rubric
8 points - problem statement
mini-literature review
describe methods by others (related or similar problems)
12 points - project quality
accurately formulate and solve problem 
Set clear objectives and milestones
clearly describe results, problems, failures, and successes
scope and significance of project.
20 points - project methods and discussion
what you did
what you found (your findings)
analysis of results
comparisons between models/approaches/architectures
results after hyper-parameter tuning
recommend a single sub-section per focus and then include all discussion within instead of chronological.
challenge factor
10 points - report quality
organization, narrative, and structure
proper citations.
diagrams/figures - WITH CAPTIONS
minimize English grammar errors.  We will not penalize directly but it will be difficult to communicate your accomplishments if you have many errors.
Do not take text from outside sources.
